        Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher
        coding challenge

    </div>
    <h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Your task is to build a project using the provided design files, integrate
      with the
      <a href="https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2"
        >REST Countries V2 API</a
      >
      to pull country data, and display it as demonstrated in the provided
      designs. You will find both a mobile and desktop version in light and dark
      mode color schemes for each page. Note that the final implementation
      doesn't have to be pixel perfect and anything close to the photos will
      suffice.
    </p>
    <h2 id="where-to-find-everything">Where to find everything</h2>
    <p>
      The design files, which are located in the
      <a href="#designs">designs</a> section below, are in JPG static format.
      This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such
      as <code>font-size</code>, <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be
      pulled from the
      <a href="https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2"
        >REST Countries V2 API</a
      >
      and you can use an icon font library for the icons.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a
      <a href="./style-guide.md"><code>style-guide.md</code></a> file, which
      contains the information you'll need, such as the color palette and fonts.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as
      <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> or
      <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</a>, but we prefer if you use Vue for this
      project. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do
      things like make HTTP requests or style your project. Note that a clean
      project structure is a bonus.
